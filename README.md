# Phishing_versus_Legitimate_Sites
The topic selected is to determine what variables most impact a website being a phishing website or a legitimate site.  

## Reason that topic was selected
This topic was selected to determine whether there were clear variables that could be used to determine if an website was phishing or legitimate. Due to recent events the needs for technological security awareness is more critical than ever. As a team, we found that our careers were all focused on the need for secure business practices.

## What are we going to answer?
Our dataset contains many variables on both legitimate and phishing websites. 
Our research will analyze if there are clear variables that could determine if a website was legitimate or illegitimate. 
Then we would like to determine which variables are most effective for determining if a website was legitimate or illegitimate.
Finally, we would like to see if there were three clear factors that could be used by the layman to determine the legitimacy of a website to best protect themselves from malicious sites.

## Machine Learning
To analyze the data, we chose to use two machine learning models to thoroughly dissect the data. We completed a logistical regression model and the balanced random forest clarifier. 

### Logisitical Regression Model
We conducted a logisitical regression model on all the variables in our data when compared to the dependent variable of Class Label. We found that the model predicted 92% of both the phishing sites and the legitimate sites in the testing data, with F1 = .92.

### Balanced Random Forest Clarifier

We found that the balanced random forest clarifier model showed that the balance accuracy score predicted .98% of both the phishing sites and the legitimate sites in the testing data. 
The three variables that had the highest predictive values were as follows: 
PctExtHyperLinks predicted 19% of the model, PctExtNulSelfRedirectyperlinksRT redicted 15% of the model, Frequent Domain Name Mismatch predicted 7.9% of the model, and PctExtResourceUrls predicted 7.3% of the model.
