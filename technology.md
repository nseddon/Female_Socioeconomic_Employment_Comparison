# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean and organize the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgres through PGAdmin4 was used to create the database and import the data.  SQLalchemy within a jupyter notebook is used to import the data from the database
into the machine learning model.

## Machine Learning
Using a Jupyter Notebook, we will use SciKitLearn module.  This will allow us to create our training and testing datasets, build the model, and finally produce
the result matrices needed to interpret the model.  This will lead into further development for the upcoming segments of the project.

## Dashboard
The team has decided to use Google Slides for the final presentation.  Currently we are using PowerPoint to produce the mockup.  Incorporation of various visualizations
is still being determined.
